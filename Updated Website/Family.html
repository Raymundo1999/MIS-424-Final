		My family has helped me so much during my school life that they have made it very fun to go to my school and they have also helped me in the 
        bad times in example is when I was Operated and wasn't able to do anything they would do anything to help me get to school drive me there and many other things.

    Something that I have had issues with and I belive many other students have is that 
    I have had many panic attacks and every time something like that happens 
    my family is always there to help me with and they all help me in different ways
    my sister will usually talk to be about it while she takes me to see a movie and my mom
    always assures me that I can always take a break if I want and she is always there for me.
